Licensing Standards
#################################

There are two different types of licenses covered in this document -
**software licenses** and **content licenses**.

"Inbound" means a license on someone else's intellectual property, which we
are using in some form. "Outbound" refers to a license we place on our own
intellectual property.

Software Licenses
==================================
These licenses relate exclusively to source code and software libraries.

Inbound License Criteria
------------------------------------------------
Any acceptable inbound software license must meet the following criteria:

- The license must meet the `Open Source Definition <https://opensource.org/osd-annotated>`_,
  and be `approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) <https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical>`_.
- The license must be `permissive <https://opensource.org/faq#permissive>`_.
  This means that no restrictions are placed on derivative works in regards to
  licensing or usage.
- The license must be `GPLv3 compatible <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses>`_.

Inbound Source Licenses (Short List)
------------------------------------------------
The following licenses are already verified as meeting our criteria, and
thus, are fully usable. This list is not exhaustive. Other licenses may be
usable as well.

- `Apache 2.0 <https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>`_
- `BSD-2/FreeBSD <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause>`_
- `BSD-3 <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_
- `Free Public License 1.0.0 <https://opensource.org/licenses/FPL-1.0.0>`_
- `MIT License <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_
- `University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License <https://opensource.org/licenses/NCSA>`_
- `SIL Open Font License <https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1>`_ (for fonts)
- `zlib/libpng <https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib>`_

.. NOTE:: The `GNU Lesser General Public License v3 (LGPLv3) <https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0>`_
   is usable if we are only linking against the LGPLv3-licensed library. Under
   no circumstances may LGPLv3 source code be used directly. We do prefer to
   avoid this license when possible.

Outbound Licenses
------------------------------------------------
At this time, there are two licenses which we use for our code.

The `BSD 3-Clause License <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_
is to be used for all code which shall be permissively open source. This
supersedes our prior use of the MIT License. This license was selected
for the third clause, which guards against implied endorsement.

The `GNU General Public License (GPL v3) <https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0>`_
is used for libraries which we want to offer under a dual-license setup.
Other GPL projects may be use GPLv3 code, but no other code may.

Open Source/Free Software Stance
------------------------------------------------
MousePaw Media completely and publicly endorses the platform and goals of
the Open Source Initiative, which we aim to further support and promote
through our company's activity. We want to encourage the widespread and
dominant adoption of open source software and open standards, especially
in the sphere of education.

We do NOT endorse the strict anti-proprietary stance of Free Software Foundation
or said intent behind its licenses.

Content Licenses
===============================================

These licenses relate to anything that is **not** source code, including but
not limited to graphics, music, audio, text, and video.

Inbound Licenses
------------------------------------------------

We can use any material which has one of the following licenses:

- `Apache 2.0 <https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0>`_ (for fonts)
- `Creative Commons 0 <https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0/>`_ (CC0)
- `Creative Commons Attribution 1.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/>`_ (CC-BY-1.0)

Outbound Licenses
------------------------------------------------

We may wish to make some of our material publicly available via Creative
Commons. When we do so, we use one of the following licenses.

..  IMPORTANT:: The licensing terms of any content must be approved by
    Anne McDonald or Jason C. McDonald! A large majority of our content
    is copyrighted, as that is essential to our ability to sell our products.

We use `Creative Commons Non-Commercial No-Derivatives 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/>`_
(CC-NC-ND-4.0) when we want to make content freely available, but do not want
it modified or used in commercial projects. This licenses allow teachers to
use the content directly, as long as they don't modify it.

We use `Creative Commons Non-Commercial 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0>`_
(CC-NC-4.0) when we want to be make content freely available to use and modify,
but do not want it used in commercial projects. This license also accommodates
use in schools, but it additionally allows for the material to be used
creatively.

We use `Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0) <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0>`_
when we want to allow anyone to use the content freely, for any
project they want, even commercially. Because we rely so heavily on this
license for inbound content, it is only fair that we give back some content
as well.
