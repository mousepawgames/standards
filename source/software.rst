Disallowed Software
=====================================

..  NOTE:: This list doesn't apply to open source contributors, although we
    strongly discourage it.

Why Disallow Software?
--------------------------------------

The idea of “Officially Disallowing” software for company use might initially
seem to be overkill, but there is a logic to it. The decision is, again, not
made lightly. In most cases, the software title in question contains security
and privacy issues, bugs, or compatibility issues that make its use a
significant business and development risk. In other cases, the software is
disallowed on grounds of licensing issues. Paying several thousand dollars
extra for commercial licensing is impractical when there is equivalent
open-source software available.

It is worth noting that, while not the sole factor, drastic conflicts in
business ethics were also taken into consideration. MousePaw Media is built
around the conviction that educational and creative technologies should be
accessible to everyone, not just those with a lot of money. Relying on
corporations whose business practices are at stark odds with this ethic is,
frankly, counter-intuitive.

Disallowed Software List
----------------------------------------

The following may NOT be used for company purposes, under any circumstances,
unless otherwise noted or unless special permission is given by a supervisor.
If you need more details, talk to Jason C. McDonald directly. (You are welcome
to use these for personal reasons all you want.

Adobe
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No Adobe products may be used for development, due to licensing costs,
file-type compatibility, and ethical concerns. (All useful Adobe products have
an open-source equivalent in our present standards.) This includes Adobe Flash.

Autodesk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No Autodesk products may be used for development, due to licensing costs,
file-type compatibility, and ethical concerns. (All useful Autodesk products
have an open-source equivalent in our present standards.) This includes
AutoCAD, 3ds Max, Maya, and Sketchbook.

Existing files may be opened with personal copies of Autodesk software for
review and export purposes only.

MP3 File Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to licensing and patent concerns, the MP3 format may NOT be used for any
audio.

EXCEPTION: A copy (NOT the master) of the audio may be saved as an MP3 for
compatibility with third-party services and software. Distribution in MP3 is
only allowed if the distribution platform strictly requires that format.

Microsoft Edge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to concerns over Microsoft's Terms of Service (see Microsoft Windows 10),
Microsoft Edge is NOT to be used under any circumstances for company purposes,
including (but not limited to) accessing the staff network,
company-commissioned web design, or accessing any website for work-related
reasons.

..  NOTE: Our web design standards only support Edge collaterally.

Microsoft Internet Explorer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to serious security and performance issues, Microsoft Internet Explorer is
NOT to be used under any circumstances for company purposes, including (but not
limited to) accessing the staff network, company-commissioned web design, or
accessing any website for work-related reasons.

..  NOTE: Our web design standards only support IE collaterally.

Microsoft Outlook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to licensing, glitches, and security issues, Microsoft Outlook is NOT to be
used for accessing company email accounts or calendars. Additionally, employees
may not forward their company mail to an Outlook account.

Microsoft Office
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to some ODT compatibility issues, and a lack of in-company training and
support, Microsoft Office is NOT to be used on any company documents. The
exception to this rule has been removed.

Microsoft Visual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to platform limitations and poor backwards compatibility, the Microsoft
Visual platform and all of its elements are officially disallowed.

..  NOTE:: Visual Studio Code is completely separate from the Microsoft
    Visual platform, and is therefore allowed.

Microsoft Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See "Microsoft Windows Ban" below for details.

Microsoft Windows 10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See "Microsoft Windows Ban" below for details.

Trimble SketchUp (formerly Google SketchUp)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to licensing costs, SketchUp may only be used for internal idea drafting.

Microsoft Windows Ban
----------------------------------------

Due to serious privacy and security concerns, Microsoft Windows is banned to
varying degrees for all company work.

Affected Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Windows 10 (Total ban)
* Windows 8/8.1 (Partial ban)
* Windows 7 (Partial ban)
* Windows Vista (Partial ban)

Ban Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..  WARNING:: Windows 10's Terms of Service give Microsoft permission to access
    and use any and all of your personal data without warning for virtually
    anything they see fit, with how they worded their legal documents. More
    information in this article.

Recent updates to Windows Vista-Windows 8.1 give Microsoft that same level of
access on those operating systems. Even if Microsoft is responsible with this
ability, it creates a massive security hole.

Microsoft Windows 10 may NOT be used for any company activity or purposes,
including accessing the staff network, under any circumstances.
This is a **Total Ban**.

**Both the Total and Partial bans** forbid checking company email, accessing the
staff network, and other company activities on these operating systems.

The ban is in full effect as of November 1, 2015.

What is BANNED in both partial and total bans?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Accessing the staff network in any capacity from within Windows in any form.
* Checking out ANY company-hosted Git repositories.
* Using a Windows-hosted VirtualBox (or other VM) instance of Linux for
  company work of any sort.
* Accessing and modifying files for closed-source company projects (such as
  *Word4Word*) on affected versions of Windows.

What is PERMITTED in partial bans?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* Checking out company-maintained GitHub repositories.
* Accessing and modifying files for open-source company projects.
* Building and testing Windows binaries and intallers of open-source
  company projects.
* Generating Git patch files for open-source company projects.
* Accessing a Linux computer via a secure desktop sharing setup.
  (Permitted, but not encouraged.)
* Using a Linux-hosted VirtualBox (or other VM) instance of Windows for
  personal and permitted company work.

Will we still be supporting Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 in release?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Yes! Many schools use these versions of Windows. As such, we will
"officially support" them for the forseeable future.

What about Windows XP?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft, and no longer receives updates.
As such, Windows XP and earlier are not part of the ban, nor do I forsee them
becoming part of the ban. However, I do strongly advise caution when using
these operating systems online, as they are extremely prone to viruses and
other attacks. Please access the staff network via Linux instead whenever
possible, and simply copy files over to your Windows XP VirtualBox.

Can I use a VirtualBox of Linux in my Windows account for company work?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

No. The Linux installation on a VirtualBox is still storing files on the
Windows machine. Additionally, internet is passing through Windows. Your Linux
installation MUST be installed directly on a hard disk, and it must exist
separately and boot independently from Windows.

May I still use Windows for personal use?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Of course - we don't dictate your personal life. While I recommend evaluating
whether using Windows is essential, given the extremely high risk of your files
and personal information being stolen, the choice of whether to use, and how
much, is ultimately up to you. Some people just need Windows for that 5% of
stuff that Linux cannot do. :)

If you have questions about some use of Windows not listed here, assume "no"
and contact IT for additional information.

If you need help installing Linux on your computer, either as the only
operating system or as a dual-boot with Windows, please contact IT.
